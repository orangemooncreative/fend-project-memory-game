## How to Play

To start the game, click on any card. A timer will start and your moves will be counted. As your moves increase, your star rating will decrease. As you match cards, they will remain open until all cards are matched. Once all your cards are matched, you will be given your final stats and you can replay the game or return to the gameboard.
